# Raspberry Variable Fan Speed Install Procedure

The fanGo.py file is the program written in python for fan management. To be able to use it, make sure you have a python interpreter installed on your system.

For example, you can install the python interpreter using:   

    apt-get install build-essential

After to verify if it work run the fanGo.py program, type the command: 

    python fanGo.py 

To start fanGo.py automatically when the raspberry start, you need to use a linux service using fan-control.sh.
The only thing to do, you have to edit the fan-control.sh at line 15 before using it. In the line 15 you must specify in which folder the fanGo.py and init.py files are located. 
In line 15 you will find this:

    DIR= ---> YOUR FOLDER HERE <---

After editing the file you must put the fan-control.sh in the folder: 

    /etc/init.d

After change permission in the file with:

    chmod +x /etc/init.d/fan-control.sh

Go to the folder:

    cd /etc/init.d 

After you must enable the service with:
          
    systemctl enable fan-control.sh

and

    update-rc.d fan-control.sh defaults

After restart your system and verify if the fan-control service is running correctly using the command: 

    service fan-control status.

To manage the service you can use: 

    service fan-control start
    service fan-control stop
    service fan-control restart
    service fan-control status
    service fan-control reload
    service fan-control force-reload

The init.py file is a small program that is used only by the service when it is started. It used to initialize the GPIO ports.
